					<p>My name is Chris, and this is a website about my time in a Filipino farming village.
					</p> 

					<p>On New Years Day of 2017, I left a year-long truck driving stint in icy Syracuse, New York. I abruptly made the transition to life in Bakero, where I lived with my wife Licel as we waited for her United States immigration paperwork to process.</p>

					<p>Bakero is a <em>barangay</em> (the Filipino term for "village") that is around 7 kilometers from the center of Cabanatuan City. Bakero is technically part of this middle-sized city, which is the old capital of Nueva Ecija Province and big enough to have 4 malls and a bus hub. Licel's <em>barangay</em>, however, has a very rural feel. Many younger adults commute to the central city for jobs, but the landscape of Bakero is dominated by rice paddies, fields of native tropical vegetables, and guava orchards.</p>

					<p>I had already spent a couple months in Bakero back when Licel and I got married at the end of 2015, so I knew what to expect. A year and two months of waiting for the visa was plenty of time to gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation of Pinoy <em>barangay</em> life. Although I eventually got a good internet connection and an online job teaching English to Chinese students, I had plenty of free time with my wife, my-laws, and our family friends. Some of these friends have a guava orchard, where I spent lots of time before I started teaching.</p>

					<p>The <a href="blog.html">blog</a> and <a href="photogallery.html">photos</a> here tell the story of my rural Filipino life. I hope you enjoy what you read and see.</p>
