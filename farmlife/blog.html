			<h2>Boiling Balut and Planting Papayas</h2>

      		<p class="first-paragraph">After days of commuting by scooter in the hot sun, we are relaxing here on this cool and rainy day. Just a light and steady shower with no wind. This weather is perfect for the vegetable gardens. It is not so great for the mother bibi that was incubating a nest, thanks to leaks in the duck cabana. We couldn't get to the nest in time, but it turned out that the eggs were duds anyways.</p>

      		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/balut.jpg" alt="balut">
			</div>

       		<p>Not all was lost, though, because duck eggs with developing embryos just happen to be a delicacy in the Philippines. When boiled and eaten with seasonings and a spoon, this dish is called "balut."</p>

			<p>There were also balut eggs under the pile of scrap wood and sheet metal, where the ducks had been laying eggs to self incubate in the heat. Licel and Arvi must have eaten three or four each. They tried to get me to join them, but balut is the one thing in the Philippines that I cannot bring myself to try, even if it is from our own backyard. Something about the developing bones and guts in the boiled meat.</p>

        	<p>Licel taught me how to tell a balut egg from an unfertilized egg. If the yolk is dark and settled over to one side of the egg, as visible through the shell when boiled, then it is balut. One of the cooked eggs had a round yellow yolk, so I claimed this one for myself.</p>

        	<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/papaya.jpg" alt="cut up papaya">	
			</div>

	        <p>Earlier in the day, Licel and Arvi brought home a huge and juicy papaya as a side dish. A perfect snack for a rainy day because I realized that it was a good time to start the next generation of backyard fruit trees. The trees we have are really "vegetable trees" because all our papayas are green for now, but they are still homegrown and edible.</p>

	        <p>When I stepped outside to cook dinner, I threw a good portion of seeds in the empty area of the soaked pechay bed. I fed the rest of the seeds to the birds.</p>

			<h2>Coming Home to Guava Honey Pancakes</h2>

      		<p class="first-paragraph">Licel and I had a safe flight back from Kuala Lumpur yesterday, and the usual ordeal of Manila to Bakero by bus and tricycle was surprisingly smooth. We got a bit of good news the other day when our plane landed.  We were together and had our marriage certificate with us, so we asked the immigration officer for the "Balik Bayan Stamp" and the friendly man gave me one in my passport.  </p>

      		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/pancakes.jpg" alt="guava honey pancakes">	
			</div>

       		<p> This stamp gives me the right to stay with my wife in the Philippines for up to a year. It means there is no more need to spend thousands of pesos on wasting a whole day to travel to Immigration in Manila or Angeles City. The Balik Bayan visa waver also makes our plans more flexible. We still need to go to work in a few months, but now I can wait for a passport renewal to process. I need to do this to make sure that a long term work visa doesn't conflict with the expiration date in the middle of next year.</p>

			<p> We came home to rice and duck adobo, which was a special request from Licel to Imben because it is time to start thinning out the flock of birds again. It was also great because we missed real food this past week. We had to live on 7-11 bread, grocery store crackers and noodles, and American fast food chains due to both of us getting food poisoning from an unknown Malaysian street food dish.  </p>

        	<p>We had to stock up on those groceries that we can't grow ourselves after we got home. We found a 50 peso box of pancake mix. When I told Licel that you cannot make pancakes without syrup, she reminded me that we have a big bottle of honey that her daughter Famela had brought back from Taiwan as a gift. I agreed that the honey is a good syrup substitute.  </p>

        	<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/camoteflower.jpg" alt="Blooming Camote flower">	
			</div>

	        <p>Just before sunset, we went back to pick our camote leaves that are growing in our friend's orchard. The camote has purple flowers blooming now, and all of the guava flowers that were on the trees when I got back for the new year are now tiny fruits. Most of the immature fruits are from this batch of flowers, so the current cycle of guava harvests that is just starting up now should peak sometime in March. I am looking forward to helping the pickers and walking around the farm because it is good exercise. I need to stay active after all the walking we did in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

	        <div class="thumbnail tall-pic">
				<img src="images/cutguava.jpg" alt="cut up guavas">	
			</div>

	        <p>When we got back home, we found four fruits that were growing on the guava trees that we have in our own backyard. We ate one, and I suggested that we chop the remaining guavas and put them on top of the honey pancakes. They added some good fiber to a very sweet and filling meal, one that went down great with herbal tea at our little front patio table.</p>

			<h2>Improving The Puppy Fence</h2>

      		<p class="first-paragraph">Freaky, Fleeky, and Panda have gotten big enough to break into the duck and chicken range. We had fenced off this part of the yard for the most part, but the puppies were still able to get up to the raised vegetable bed and back down to the birds.</p>

      		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/trikefence.jpg" alt="loading the fence on the tricycle">	
			</div>

       		<p>The fix seemed simple enough when we went out to get a section of bamboo fencing, which is extremely cheap but strong enough to separate dogs and birds. One was all that was needed for the vegetable garden because we only had to wall off one and a half sides. When I helped Imben put the fence up, we found a piece of scrap wood that could block up the half side next to the gate to the bird area.</p>

			<p>The puppies were in their crates while we were dealing with the fence. They had been there since our recent vacation because they were making it impossible for Gladys to keep the yard clean while she was housesitting. Almost immediately after I let them out, Licel wanted them back in the crates because they were knocking over the garbage and chewing up everything they could find.  I hate to see puppies sitting in cages all they when they should be playing, so I insisted that I would clean up after them and find ways to puppy proof the yard.   It took some chicken casualties for me to put practicality over perceived animal cruelty.
			</p>

        	<p> The problem with the fence is that it stops the ducks but not the chickens, which have clipped wings but are strong enough to jump, flap their wings, and get high enough to clear the fence.  There are only three left, and they are all supposed to be birthday gifts so we don't want to lose any of them. We just narrowly saved Gladys' and Precy's birthday dinners from getting slaughtered by Freaky weeks in advance, but we couldn't stop Fleeky from killing our neighbor Mario's chickens. He has a small, brown breed that can fly over our front yard wall and forage in our flower gardens, and as soon as Licel told me that one of them was dead it was back in the cage for the puppies.</p>

        	<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/duckfence.jpg" alt="the finished fence">	
			</div>

	        <p>Hopefully they will mellow out with age and become like their mother. There is one bit of good that the fence did, and that was to allow Itim to be free of her chain by the puppy crates. Itim is an egg eater, but she is too old and lazy to chase live birds and chew up garbage. We can trust her when we aren't watching her, and it is nice to have her with me when I am on the patio having my morning coffee and my evening herbal tea.</p>

			<h2>Homebrewed Guyabano Tea for Our Health
			</h2>

      		<p class="first-paragraph">We ate a lot of food this past weekend. Licel's daughter, Famela, invited us down to her husband's family farm near Gapan for a sister in law's wedding. Our hosts served a lot of lechon baboy, and the same thing happened the next day over in Palayan City at a family birthday party.</p>

      		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/lechonbaboy.jpg" alt="lechon baboy: pig roasting on a spit">	
			</div>

       		<p>We pretty much ate meat from pigs roasted over a fire, with all the skin and fat, for two days straight. This dish is very delicious when eaten hot and fresh off the spit, but Licel was concerned about our blood pressure after all of the saturated fat and cholesterol. She told me that lot of people have died of high blood pressure in Bakero lately. Cigarettes and excessive alcohol probably played a role in most of the deaths, but my wife has a valid concern about us eating too much stuff that we shouldn't while at family celebrations.</p>

       		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/guyabanoleaves.jpg" alt="guyabano leaves in a pot">	
			</div>

			<p>Licel knows a good natural treatment that is supposed to prevent high blood pressure. The guyabano tea that she started brewing after this weekend apparently has other health benefits too. So far, I think there is something to this tea, because it certainly feels detoxifying every time I make a trip to the bathroom.
			</p>

			<div class="thumbnail tall-pic">
				<img src="images/guyabanotea.jpg" alt="guyabano teacup">	
			</div>

        	<p>Licel makes the tea from guyabano trees. We have one growing in our backyard in the duck pasture. There are a couple more along the path to the farm, and several she can pick from along our public street. All she does is throw as many fresh leaves as she can into a big pot and boil the water for around a half hour. This yields around three liters of guyabano tea, which she bottles and chills in the fridge.</p>

        	<div class="thumbnail tall-pic">
				<img src="images/guyabanotree.jpg" alt="guyabano tree and fruit">	
			</div>

	        <p>Since the pig fat filled wedding and birthday, we have been drinking a few glasses of guyabano tea a day. It has an earthy yet decent flavor. It is really good with honey, but I usually drink it unsweetened because I don't want to develop diabetes while avoiding hypertension with Licel's refreshing drink.</p>

			<h2>Fiesta Time</h2>

      		<p class="first-paragraph">The annual Barangay Bakero Fiesta, in honor of Saint Joseph, came at a very good time. The fiesta date just happens to be my birthday!</p>

      		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/truck.jpg" alt="farm truck in front of our house">
			</div>

       		<p>We are also celebrating the fact that our friends have apparently stopped the guava thieves.  The guard shack is finished, and there is mosquito netting and a small LED lantern back there for the nighttime security duty.  There are also two dogs watching the farm at all times.  We volunteered Itim in order to help out, so she lives back there now. Imben's puppy is chained to the other side of the shack. His name is <em>Putot</em>, which means &quot;no tail,&quot; and he is quite the barker.</p>

       		<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/cabanashade.jpg" alt="guard dogs in the shade">
			</div>

			<p>We had quite the house party for the barangay fiesta. Between extended family and neighbors, we fed around 70 people today. We also had people over for a few nights to help clean and prepare all the food. A couple of the helpers were Licel's friends from the care-giving course she took last year. Licel's daughter, Famela, is still in the Philippines waiting for her next contract to start in Taiwan, so she also helped out and spent the weekend with Carl and her husband Arvin.</p>

			<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/fiestaveggies.jpg" alt="huge basket of vegetables">
			</div>

        	<p>We had a lot of food for all these people. We bought pork from a neighbor, and another guy down the road was selling carabao meat. Famela's family brought two chickens. The three ducks that we roasted came from our backyard flock, which is now pretty much down to Pappy and the nearly fully grown peking ducks. </p>

        	<div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/duckmeat.jpg" alt="a freshly slaughtered and cleaned duck">
			</div>

	        <p class="clear-float">Besides all the meat, we had a ton of noodles from the grocery store and vegetables from the public market in the city. Our sweet stuff was a big can of ice cream and a few boxes of puto that we got from street vendors that Licel had made deals with. That was all topped by the cake that Anthony's girlfriend, Riza, and her family brought to the party. Even the dogs feasted!</p>

	         <div class="thumbnail">
				<img src="images/freakyfeast.jpg" alt="freaky eating the leftovers">	
			</div>

			<p>In the end, the fiesta was mostly just a lot of people visiting our home. I'm sure there was a lot going on elsewhere in Bakero, but we didn't go out because we were busy hosting. We did see the parade go by at sunset, and there was also a very short fireworks show that we watched from the street.</p>

	</div>

			<p class="clear-float">Last night, we all relaxed and treated ourselves to adult beverages to help get us in the mood for the fiesta. Imben, Maneng, and Oma came over too. Now that the last of our lunch and dinner guests have left, our overnight party preparation helpers and farm helpers are about to join us for more drinks tonight. We don't do this regularly, but sometimes it is good to let loose and celebrate our lives here!</p>
